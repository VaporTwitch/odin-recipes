            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, whole milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat the mixture on medium speed using a hand mixer or stand mixer until the batter is smooth and well mixed.</li>
                <li>Carefully stir in the boiling water into the batter. The batter will become thin, but this is normal.</li>
                <li>Divide the cake batter equally between the prepared cake pans.</li>
                <li>Bake the cakes in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the peanut butter frosting. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the creamy peanut butter and softened unsalted butter until smooth.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the powdered sugar to the peanut butter mixture, beating well after each addition.</li>
                <li>Stir in the whole milk and vanilla extract, and continue beating until the frosting is creamy and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a layer of peanut butter frosting evenly over the top of the cake.</li>
                <li>Place the second cake layer on top of the frosted one. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining peanut butter frosting.</li>
                <li>For optional toppings, you can sprinkle chocolate chips and chopped peanuts over the top of the cake.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve this delicious Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This cake is perfect for any occasion, and the combination of chocolate and peanut butter is sure to be a crowd-pleaser!</p>
