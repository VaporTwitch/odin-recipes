                <li>1 package of Quorn Pesto Fillets </li>
                <li>1 bunch of broccolini</li>
                <li>1 pound baby potatoes</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Grated Parmesan cheese </li>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature recommended on the Quorn Pesto Fillets package. Cook as instructed.</li>
                <li>Prepare the baby potatoes: Wash the baby potatoes and cut any larger ones in half so that they are roughly the same size. Place them in a pot of salted water and bring it to a boil. Cook the potatoes until they are fork-tender, which usually takes about 10-15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set them aside.</li>
                <li>Prepare the broccolini: Trim the tough ends of the broccolini and discard them. In a large bowl, toss the broccolini with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Roast the broccolini: Place the seasoned broccolini on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Roast them in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until they are tender and slightly crispy at the edges.</li>
                <li>Sauté the baby potatoes: In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the cooked baby potatoes and sauté them for a few minutes until they are slightly crispy and golden.</li>
                <li>Assemble the dish: Place the Quorn Pesto Fillets on a serving plate. Arrange the lemon broccolini and sautéed baby potatoes alongside the fillets.</li>
                <li>Serve: Optionally, you can sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese over the broccolini and potatoes for extra flavor.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now your Quorn Pesto Fillets with Lemon Broccolini and Baby Potatoes are ready to be served. It's a nutritious and satisfying meal that brings together the flavors of pesto, lemon, and fresh vegetables. Enjoy!</p>
