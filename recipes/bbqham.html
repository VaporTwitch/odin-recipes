                <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the sandwich:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound chipped ham (You can find chipped ham at some delis or use shaved deli ham.)</li>
                <li>8 hamburger buns or your favorite sandwich rolls</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Optional Toppings:</p>

                <li>Sliced pickles</li>
                <li>Coleslaw</li>
            </ul> 
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the BBQ sauce, in a medium saucepan, combine the ketchup, apple cider vinegar, water, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, prepared yellow mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
                <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
                <li>While the BBQ sauce is simmering, warm the chipped ham in a skillet or microwave until heated through.</li>
                <li>Once the BBQ sauce is ready, remove it from the heat and set it aside.</li>
                <li>To assemble the sandwiches, take a hamburger bun or sandwich roll and open it up.</li>
                <li>Place a generous amount of the warmed chipped ham on one side of the bun.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a spoonful or two of the prepared BBQ sauce over the chipped ham.</li>
                <li>If desired, add some sliced pickles and coleslaw on top of the ham and BBQ sauce.</li>
                <li>Close the sandwich with the other half of the bun.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process to make more sandwiches.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Enjoy your homemade Isaly's BBQ chipped ham sandwiches! These sandwiches are a delicious combination of flavors, and the tangy BBQ sauce complements the savory chipped ham perfectly.
